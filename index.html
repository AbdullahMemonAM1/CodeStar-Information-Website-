            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computer science is the study of computation, information, and
                automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of
                computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of
                hardware and software). Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science
                is closely related to computer programming.

                Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation concerns
                abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields
                of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for
                preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation
                of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and
                database theory concerns the management of repositories of data.Human computer interaction investigates
                the interfaces through which humans and computers interact </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
                arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can
                perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
                range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating
                system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also
                refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
                computer cluster.A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
                Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory
                devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like
                personal computersAreas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the
                principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of
                computer components and computer-operated equipment.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by computers,
                as opposed to human or animal intelligence. "Intelligence" encompasses the ability to learn and to
                reason, to generalize, and to infer meaning.[1] AI applications include advanced web search engines
                (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding
                human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools
                (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and
                Go).[2]

                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has
                experienced several waves of optimismThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around
                particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include
                reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and
                the ability to move and manipulate objectsa] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary
                problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[9] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted
                and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques</p>
